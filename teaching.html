          <h2>Core Beliefs</h2>
          <p>As a future teacher, I am committed to creating engaging and supportive classrooms where students feel inspired to explore, design, and innovate.</p>
          <p>I believe learning should be inclusive and accessible, providing every student the opportunity to succeed and develop confidence. I combine practical, hands-on projects with critical thinking so students see real-world value.</p>
          <p>Through exploring materials, technologies, and creative processes, I nurture curiosity, problem-solving, and resilience. My goal is to help students become independent learners who can adapt their skills to a changing world.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, I want students to see themselves as capable designers and innovators who can make meaningful impact.</p>

          <h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
          <p>Across my placements I develop lessons that are practical, creative, and responsive to different learners and contexts. I connect Industrial Technology, Food Tech, D&amp;T and Textiles to real-world applications—from timber projects that move from sketches to products, to essential food preparation skills. I plan, deliver, and reflect on lessons that build technical competence, confidence, and enthusiasm.</p>

          <h2><em>My Favourite Educational Quote</em></h2>
          <p>Tom Bodett: “School teaches you lessons and then gives you a test. Life gives you a test that teaches you lessons.” This reminds me that learning continues through challenges and real-world experiences. I want students to leave with confidence, reflection skills, and resilience.</p>
