    <!--These are my two paragraphs where I go into detail about me-->
    <p style="font-size: medium;">I am currently in my third year at <a href="https://www.acu.edu.au/">Australian Catholic University (ACU)</a>, undertaking a double degree: a Bachelor of Secondary Education alongside a Bachelor of Arts in Design Technologies and Innovations. My major area of study is Industrial Technology (timber and metal), with a minor in Food Technology. Throughout my studies, I have completed two teaching practicum placements that have been invaluable in developing my practical teaching skills in real classroom settingsâ€”first at Cecil Hills High School in Cecil Hills, and then at Fairvale High School in Fairfield West.</p>
